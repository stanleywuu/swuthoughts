title: 'Is this overkill?'

After weeks of tinkering, I have finally gotten my workspace to a state that I can appreciate.
Is this a little overkill for sending my grav blog to FTP?

This was all in VSCode,
I run my terminal commands in one split pane, and then FTP upload on the other.

This, my friends, is what HOLLYWOOD had promised us...
Little did I know this was always achievable.

All you need is a little linux magic... On the other hand, you probably CAN do this on Windows.

Now the Demo is over, time to fix my FTP script so it actually uploads to the correct directory
