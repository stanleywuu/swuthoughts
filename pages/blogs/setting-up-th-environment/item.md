title: 'Finding a workflow'
---

As my previous blog attempts, the first step after registering had always been to set up my machine for local development
Once again, I have dual booted Linux Mint on my Windows machine. 

This time, I wanted to set up my environment in a way that will be easy to deploy my changes.
This applies not only to the site, but also my linux configuration.

2020 was the year a lot of us have started working from home a lot *more* than what we were accustomed to. Not only did we have to live this new life of social distancing, a lot of us are forced to work in an environment that is less than ideal.

For example, six months since everyone at the company was forced to work from home. There are still developers on my team that are working off the company assigned laptop, without even an external monitor attached.
To be fair, even though I had an extra monitor lying around, I too worked off just the laptop in the first month simply because I liked to work in the kitchen (easy access to the fridge).

Eventually, as work continued to flood in, I caved in and set up my workstation. Since we are putting the effort in, I am putting a lot of focus now on establishing an efficient environment.
And the same philosophy applies to this blog, the goal is to create a process that allows me to create content for a blog as simply as possible and as efficiently (translation. lazily) as I can.

So I decided to go back to what I know the least: Setting up a Linux machine for all of the work
Here is how I am trying to keep simple

1. [Openbox Config](https://github.com/stanleywuu/Openbox-config) (Openbox config) is where I keep most of my linux config, I try to keep everything under the same directory but I'm sure something will come along eventually and ruin that setup
2. [Site Repository](https://github.com/stanleywuu/swu-site) is  where I will keep all the contents of the GRAV site, for portability and maintainability.

Here is what I have done to make this easy
* Installed Linux Mint 
* Installed Openbox 
* Installed Conky
Yes, not exactly the most efficient process as both Openbox and Conky have a ridiculous amount of configuration, but they are just SOOO much fun to play with!

In Progress
* Discovering keybindings in Qutebrowser
* Updating keybindings in Conky
* Creating scripts to copy current settings from ~/.config/openbox
* Creating scripts to publish the config settings in the repository to ~/.config/openbox
* Creating a few aliases for easy navigation
* Learning Grav
