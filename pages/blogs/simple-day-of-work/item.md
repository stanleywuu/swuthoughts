title: 'My vision of a VS code kind of day'
---
Here is the overwhelming sensation I have about Visual Studio code:
Visual Studio Code is cool!

The Extension API for VSCode is even cooler!

So when I looked up how to write extension for VSCode, and when I decided the API for writing a VSCode extension is nicely designed. I took the plunge.

One day, I want to be able to do ALL of my work using VS Code.
I could do everything in VS code while greatly reduce the use of mouse movement.

I can use an extension to chat on Slack.
Potentially I could respond to emails? Or even better, not respond to emails at all!

But seriously? Why couldn't it happen?
While it's not Vim, VS code has decent navigation support around all of its component.

Ctrl + Shift + ` to open a new terminal
Ctrl + Shift + 5 to split terminals
Ctrl + P to open files
Don't forget the almight Shift + F5
Of course you have the Ctrl + Tab to tab

With a Vim plugin, go to definition is as easy as typing gd on the keyboard

I long for the day where more and more can be done on VS Code for the following benefit
* Minimizing the time I have to switch to a different window (Visual Studio, or SQL Management studio for example)
* Rather than using alt+tab or visually inspecting tasks in Tasks bar, I would rather press Ctrl + Shift + P and enter
"Visual " to take me to Visual Studio Code, or "SQL " to take me to a SQL pane that was previously hidden

Am I describing VSCode or am I describing another editor? :p
Who knows? So far, none of this seem too far fetched, there are already a ton of SQL extensions available
There are chat plugins that boast having graphical interface
You can play SNAKE on VSCode,
You can run DOSBOX and play Doom.

Today, VSCode seems to be easiest entryway towards the world I would like to live in.
Hopefully there already exists enough extensions to make this a reality.

Make it happen, Internet!!
